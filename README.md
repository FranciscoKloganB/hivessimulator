# Hives Simulator

Hives is a simulation framework for Python language that favors quick algorithm implementation for researchers working on topics related to distributed file systems. We release our program as an open-source because we feel like there are few other alternatives for Pythonistas. PeerSim and Peerfact.KOM are both great P2P simulators, but they only support Java. Moreover, many other well-known simulators usually do not support Python as a programming language. An unfortunate fact, seeing that this simple yet powerful language offers some of the best mathematical and data science packages out there and is a viable solution to the expensive and licensed Matlab.

This project is far from being time-efficient and supports at most 10^4 network nodes. However, it is very easy to configure, modify, and extend using inheritance and polymorphism features of the Python language. We bundle several classes representing Network Nodes, Master Servers, and Cluster Groups to the users' satisfaction. We believe that data and science should come before programming when it comes to research, hence our focus on usability rather than pure performance.

The project source code and documentation follow the conventions enumerated in [Google Styles Available](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
And our [documentation website](https://www.hivessimulator.tech), including a quick-start guide.
