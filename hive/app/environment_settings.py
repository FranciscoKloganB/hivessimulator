"""Module with simulation and project related variables.

This module demonstrates holds multiple constant variables that are used
through out the simulation's lifetime including initialization and execution.

Note:
    To configure the amount of available
    :py:class:`Network Nodes <app.domain.network_nodes.Node>` system,
    the initial size of a file
    :py:class:`Cluster Group <app.domain.cluster_groups.Cluster>` that
    work on the durability of a file, the way files are
    :py:meth:`distributed <app.domain.cluster_groups.Cluster.spread_files>`
    among the clusters' nodes at the start of a simulation and, the actual
    name of the file whose persistence is being simulated, you should create
    a simulation file using this :py:mod:`script <app.simfile_generator>` and
    follow the respective instructions. To run the script type in your
    command line terminal:

    |

    ::

        $ python simfile_generator.py --file=filename.json

    |

    It is also strongly recommended that the user does not alter any
    undocumented attributes or module variables unless they are absolutely
    sure of what they do and the consequence of their changes. These include
    variables such as :py:const:`~app.environment_settings.SHARED_ROOT` and
    :py:const:`~app.environment_settings.SIMULATION_ROOT`.
